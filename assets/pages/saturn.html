      <h3>Namesake:</h3>
      <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>
    </div>

  <div class="planet-info-wrapper">
    <div class="planet-info">
      <h3>Formation:</h3>
      <p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.</p>

      <h3>Size and Distance:</h3>
      <p>With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet overall.

        From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.
        
        It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="planet-info-wrapper">
    <div class="planet-info">
      <h3>Orbit and Rotation:</h3>
      <p>As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.

        Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.</p>

      <h3>Geography:</h3>
      <p>Earth is the third planet from the sun and the largest of the terrestrial planets. It has a diameter of approximately 12,742 km and a mass of 5.97 x 10^24 kg. Earth's surface is covered by 71% water, and its land area consists of seven continents, including North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Antarctica. The highest point on Earth is Mount Everest, which stands at 8,848 meters above sea level. Earth also has a number of natural features, such as mountains, valleys, rivers, and deserts.</p>

    <div class="planet-info">
      <h3>Atmosphere:</h3>
      <p>Earth's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%) with small amounts of other gases such as argon and carbon dioxide. The atmosphere plays a vital role in supporting life on Earth by regulating temperature, protecting against harmful solar radiation, and providing the air we breathe. The atmosphere is divided into five layers, including the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere.</p>

    <div class="planet-info">
      <h3>Climate:</h3>
      <p>Earth's climate is influenced by a number of factors, including the amount of solar radiation received, the tilt of Earth's axis, and the distribution of land and water. Earth's climate has been in a constant state of flux over millions of years, with periods of warming and cooling. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have contributed to an increase in global temperatures in recent decades, leading to concerns about climate change and its impact on the planet.</p>

    <div class="planet-info">
      <h3>Biosphere:</h3>
      <p>Earth is home to a vast array of living organisms, from single-celled bacteria to complex animals and plants. The biosphere includes all areas of Earth where life can be found, including the atmosphere, land, and oceans. Life on Earth is sustained by a variety of ecosystems, including forests, oceans, grasslands, and wetlands. Human activities, such as pollution and habitat destruction, have had a significant impact on many of these ecosystems, leading to concerns about the loss of biodiversity.</p>

    <div class="planet-info">
      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
      <p>In conclusion, Earth is a unique and complex planet that has sustained life for billions of years. Its geography, atmosphere, climate, and biosphere are all interconnected and play a vital role in supporting the diverse array of life found on the planet. However, human activities have had a significant impact on Earth's natural systems, and there is an urgent need to take action to protect the planet for future generations.</p>
